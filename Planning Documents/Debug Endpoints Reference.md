**When to use:** When auto-restore doesn't work or for complete reset
**Why it works:** Direct database method, always succeeds

```
Status: Ready to use  
Usage: Navigate to: https://your-app-url.amplifyapp.com/api/debug/final-password-fix
Result: Forces both passwords to TempSite2024! and TempAdmin2024!
```

### 3. `/api/debug/password-monitor` üìä **STATUS CHECK**
**What it does:** Shows current password hash status and length
**When to use:** To check if passwords exist before attempting fixes
**Why it's useful:** Diagnostic tool to understand the problem

```
Status: Ready to use

### 10. `/api/debug/all-env` üìã **ALL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES**
**What it does:** Lists all environment variables available to the application
**When to use:** When debugging Amplify environment variable issues
**Why it's comprehensive:** Shows everything available to troubleshoot naming

### 11. `/api/debug/supabase-direct-test` üéØ **DIRECT DATABASE TEST**
**What it does:** Bypasses abstraction layers to test raw Supabase operations
**When to use:** When suspecting database connectivity or persistence issues
**Why it's thorough:** Tests credentials, read, update, and password operations

## üìù **USAGE PATTERNS**

### **Common Issue Resolution Flow:**

1. **Can't login to anything:** ‚Üí `/api/debug/auto-password-restore`
2. **Auto-restore didn't work:** ‚Üí `/api/debug/final-password-fix`  
3. **Config won't save:** ‚Üí `/api/debug/config` then `/api/debug/env`
4. **Files won't load:** ‚Üí `/api/debug/test-content`
5. **Chat won't load:** ‚Üí `/api/debug/test-iframe`
6. **Want to check status:** ‚Üí `/api/debug/password-monitor`

### **Preventive Maintenance:**
- Bookmark `/api/debug/auto-password-restore` for quick access
- Use incognito/private browsing for admin access
- Clear browser cache if autocomplete issues occur
- Avoid unnecessary admin configuration changes

---

## üéØ **DEFAULT CREDENTIALS**

- **Site Password:** `TempSite2024!`
- **Admin Password:** `TempAdmin2024!`

These are restored by all password fix endpoints.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT NOTES**

1. **Browser Caching:** Clear cache/cookies if login issues persist
2. **Autocomplete:** Type passwords manually, don't rely on browser autofill  
3. **Incognito Mode:** Use for admin access to avoid caching issues
4. **Rate Limiting:** Use `/api/debug/rate-limit-check` if locked out
5. **Persistence:** Password issues can recur due to admin panel bug
